# Ranking-Fifa-Player
In this project, we analyzed FIFA player data from 2015 to 2020 to uncover trends in player performance and global football. 
I used clustering to group players by skill sets and identified top football-producing countries. 
We also analyzed player ratings by age and found that strikers tend to earn the highest salaries.
This project enhanced my skills in clustering, feature engineering, and dataÂ visualization.
